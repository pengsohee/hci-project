          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            SaffCoZ was born from the passion of Safiya Colenze, a young woman from a small coastal town surrounded by lavender fields and citrus orchards. Inspired by the natural scents of her homeland, Safiya began experimenting with blending oils and fragrances in her family's workshop. Her first creation, a perfume named "Gratitude," captured the essence of her hometown and quickly became a local favorite. Encouraged by its success, Safiya established SaffCoZ‚Äîa name that combined her own and symbolized her vision of crafting timeless, evocative fragrances.
